- 📢 **[2025-07-28]** We are pleased to release [**LiveSQLBench-Base-Lite-SQLite**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/livesqlbench-base-lite-sqlite), extending from PostgreSQL to SQLite dialect to improve accessibility. Please check another repo [BIRD-Mini-Dev v2](https://github.com/bird-bench/mini_dev/tree/main/live_sql_bench_sqlite) and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/livesqlbench-base-lite-sqlite) for more details.

- 📢 **[2025-05-30]** We are pleased to release [**LiveSQLBench-Base-Lite**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/livesqlbench-base-lite), featuring 18 end-user level databases and 270 tasks (180 SELECT-only, 90 Management tasks). Each task involves unambiguous and straightforward user queries grounded in external knowledge, with medium to hard complexity SQL statements.


## 🚀 Overview

LiveSQLBench (BIRD-SQL Pro v0.5) is a **contamination-free**, **continuously evolving** benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on **complex, real-world text-to-SQL tasks**, featuring **diverse real-world user queries**, including **Business Intelligence (BI)**, **CRUD operations**, and more. Each release will include **50 new, fully open-source DBs** curated by the BIRD team through expert collaboration and continuous improvement. It will cover a **wide range of database sizes**, from **end-user level** (around 127 columns) to **industrial level** (1340+ columns).

Here are the features of the LiveSQLBench benchmark:

1. **🗄️ Live Databases:**
Constructed dynamically from extensive and regularly updated CSV datasets, with both base (user-end level) and large (industrial level) versions (1340+ columns each DB) to test scalability.

2. **💬 Live User Queries and SQL:**
Each task pairs unambiguous user queries with annotated, gold-standard SQL statements. The user queries are grounded in an external knowledge base, with medium to hard complexity solution SQL statements.

3. **🧠 Contextual Reasoning (HKB):**
Every DB includes a hierarchical knowledge base (HKB) where each knowledge may have dependencies to others, which requires the multi-hop reasoning ability. Two HKB formats are provided: (1) structured JSON format, and (2) unstructured Document format.

4. **🔍 The First Full SQL Spectrum:**
Supports not just SELECT (Business Intelligence) queries, but also CRUD (e.g., UPDATE, CREATE, and other database management operations) queries.

5. **⚡ Automated Evaluation:**
Support fast evaluation via PostgreSQL template & docker. Each question includes verifiable test cases for accurate, reproducible scoring. Soft EX metric is used to evaluate SELECT-ONLY tasks; customized test cases are designed for DBA tasks, such as CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE). 

6. **🔄 Truly Live & Hidden Test:**
New databases and tasks are added over time. Each release features both open development and hidden test phases. The hidden test set from each release becomes the open development set for the next release, ensuring continuous evolution and fair evaluation.

### 🎯 Current Release: LiveSQLBench-Base-Lite and LiveSQLBench-Base-Full

We have released **LiveSQLBench-Base-Lite** and **LiveSQLBench-Base-Full**, featuring:
- **New end-user level databases** with complex relationships and noisy schema and data.

For the full dataset, please email: **[📧 bird.bench25@gmail.com](mailto:bird.bench25@gmail.com)** with subject tag `[livesqlbench-base-lite GT&Test Cases]` for Lite version or `[livesqlbench-base-full-v1 GT&Test Cases]` for Full version, which will be sent automatically.




## 💨 Quick Eval (LiveSQLBench-Base-Lite)

### Prepare the Dataset

Download the dataset containing DB's hkb, column meaning, schema and the `livesqlbench_data.jsonl` file:
```bash
cd livesqlbench
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/livesqlbench-base-lite
```

Integrate the data file containing the annotated fields (obtained from the email) with the `livesqlbench_data.jsonl` file by running the following command:
```bash
python integrate_gt_data.py --gt_file <path_to_gt_file> 
```


### Generation Environment Setup
To run the baseline code to generate LLM outputs, you need to install the following dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n livesqlbench python=3.10 -y
conda activate livesqlbench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generation
You also need to setup the model name (eg., **gpt-4o-2024-11-20**) with the API key in the `config.py` file. Then you can run the following command to generate the output:
```bash
# Generate the prompt
cd baseline/run
bash generate_prompt.sh

# LLM Inference, need to set the API key in config.py
bash run_baseline.sh
```
The output will be save in the [`./evaluation/outputs/final_output/`](./evaluation/outputs/final_output/)



### Evaluation Environment Setup

We use **docker** to provide a consistent environment for running the benchmark. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Build the docker compose using pre-built images
    ```bash
    cd evaluation
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up 
    ```
    This contains three containers:
    - `livesqlbench_postgresql`: the PostgreSQL database for the base-lite DB Environment
    - `livesqlbench_postgresql_base_full`: the PostgreSQL database for the base-full DB Environment
    - `livesqlbench_so_eval_env`: the environment for the evaluation

    Just comment out the `postgresql_base_full` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file if you only want to evaluate the base-lite version.


2. (Optional) Build the docker images from scratch
   - Downdload the database dumps 
      - [livesqlbench-base-lite](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QIGQlRKbkqApAOrQXPqFJgUg8rQ7HRRZ/view). Unzip and rename it as `evaluation/postgre_table_dumps`.
      - [livesqlbench-base-full](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V9SFIWebi27JtaDUAScG1xE9ELbYcWLR/view). Unzip and rename it as `evaluation/postgre_table_dumps_full`.
   - Build the environment manually by running `docker-compose.build.yml`.
      ```bash
      cd evaluation
      docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml build
      docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d
      ```

3. (Recommended) Check the database containers are built and running successfully.

-  Print the container build logs to ensure that the databases are built successfully without errors:
   ```bash 
   docker logs livesqlbench_postgresql > build_livesqlbench_postgresql.log 2>&1
   docker logs livesqlbench_postgresql_base_full > build_livesqlbench_postgresql_base_full.log 2>&1
   ```
   If errors occur, `"Errors occurred during import:"` will be printed in the log files.


-  Check if the database containers are in good shape.
   
   Use our provided Python script to verify database metadata:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec so_eval_env bash
   python check_db_metadata.py --host livesqlbench_postgresql
   python check_db_metadata.py --host livesqlbench_postgresql_base_full
   ```
   
   Expected results:
   - **livesqlbench-base-lite**: 
     - 📈 Total Databases: 18
     - 📋 Total Tables: 175
     - 🔢 Total Columns: 2286
     - 📈 Avg Rows per Table: 1,038.48
     - 💾 Total Size: 207.15 MB (around)
   - **livesqlbench-base-full**: 
     - 📈 Total Databases: 22
     - 📋 Total Tables: 244
     - 🔢 Total Columns: 2011
     - 📈 Avg Rows per Table: 1,121.19
     - 💾 Total Size: 272.00 MB (around)
   

### Evaluation Run
Exec into the `livesqlbench_so_eval_env` container and start the evaluation:
```bash
docker compose exec so_eval_env bash
cd run
bash run_eval.sh 
```
The output will be save in the [`./evaluation/outputs/final_output/`](./evaluation/outputs/final_output/)
If you want the log file for each instance, you can set the `--logging` to `true` in the `run_eval.sh` script.

## 💨 Quick Eval (LiveSQLBench-Base-Full)

Similar to the above, but do the following changes:

1. Change the databaes metafiles and livesqlbench_data.jsonl to the full version from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/birdsql/livesqlbench-base-full-v1).
2. Use the new data to generate the prompts and then use the new generated prompt get LLM outputs and then postprocess it.
3. When running the evaluation, you need to set the database host to `livesqlbench_postgresql_base_full`:
```bash
docker compose exec so_eval_env bash
cd run
jsonl_file=<path_to_the_full_set_postprocessed_jsonl_file>
python3 /app/src/evaluation.py --jsonl_file $jsonl_file  --db_host "postgresql_base_full"
```

Please compute a comprehensive DPQ index for each archaeological location. Present the results in descending order of DPQ values, displaying only the site identification code, site designation, and calculated DPQ value (rounded to two decimal places) to facilitate prioritization of our digital preservation resources."*

\* Example2 (more colloquial): *"To better allocate our digital preservation resources, I need to identify which archaeological sites have the most robust digital records. Can you generate a ranked list showing each site's primary identifier, its designation, and a metric quantifying its digital preservation quality? Please sort the list to show the highest-quality sites first, with the quality metric rounded to the second decimal."*
